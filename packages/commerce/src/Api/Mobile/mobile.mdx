# Is Mobile Signal

It's a preact signal that is true when screen side less than 1024px.
It automatically re-renders preact components that read that value when screen is resized.

## Usage

```jsx
import mobileSignal from '~/Api/Mobile';

function Component() {
    const mobile = mobileSignal.value;
    return <div>{mobile ? <p>mobile</p> : <p>desktop</p>}</div>;
}
```
